                In Parkland's sunlit embrace you stay,<br>
                While I'm afar in Cincinnati's sway.<br>
                Though miles apart, my heart's display<br>
                Is celebrating with you on this Father's Day.<br><br>

                Wiggy, dear dad, with love profound,<br>
                I miss your laugh, your voice's sound.<br>
                But know, in spirit, I'm always around,<br>
                In every thought, in every joy we've found.<br><br>

                Today, Dad, let wine's mirth sway,<br>
                Indulge freely, it's your special day!<br>
                Toast to memories, both old and new,<br>
                For in my heart, I'm celebrating with you.<br><br>

                Happy Father's Day, from miles away,<br>
                In spirit, united, come what may.<br>
                To the best dad, with love that won't decay,<br>
                Here's to you, Antonio, on your special day!
